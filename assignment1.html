    <h3> What is HTML?? </h3>
    <pre> 
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. 
    </pre>
    <img src="1st.jpg" height="200" weight="200" arc="Meeting Image"/>
    <img src="2nd.png" height="200" weight="200" arc="Setting Image"/>
    <pre>
        The <! DOCTYPE html > declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
        The < html > element is the root element of an HTML page
        The < head > element contains meta information about the HTML page
        The < title > element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
        The < body > element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
        The < h1 > element defines a large heading
        The < p > element defines a paragraph

    <img src="4th.png" height="200" weight="200" arc="Mind Image"/>
    <img src="5th.jpg" height="200" weight="200" arc="Guy with Phone Image"/>
    <p>
        Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
